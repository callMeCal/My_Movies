# My_Movies
My_Movies is a small program that creates a page that displays
information and trailers for specific movies. Almost all of the page_create.py code was pulled from the ud036_StarterCode repository file fresh_tomatoes provided by Udacity.

# Installation
Simply clone the repository from https://github.com/callMeCal/My_Movies.git to your local machine.

# Usage
To add movies simply add instances of media.Movie to entertainment_center.py.

To create the page, run the entertainment_center.py file. Make sure the movies variable includes all instances of media.Movie.
